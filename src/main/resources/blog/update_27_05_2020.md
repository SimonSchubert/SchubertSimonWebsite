## Why
I'm a big fan of RSS feeds and like the stuff I follow to be chronically ordered. And I know I'm not the only one out there. Also, my [FreeMovies](https://open.lbry.com/FreeMovies) channel entered the top 200 most subscribed channels on LBRY which got my hyped and motivated to work on the site.

## Result
[http://whatch.online/feeds/rss.xml](http://whatch.online/feeds/rss.xml)

## The code
Create a new `feeds` folder and the `rss.xml` file.
```$kotli
val folder = File("html/feeds")
folder.mkdirs()
val file = File(folder, "rss.xml")
file.createNewFile()
```

Get all movies from the database sorted by `id` to get the newest entries first.
```
val videos = videoQueries.selectAll().executeAsList().sortedBy { it.id }
```

Build a string from the `videos` array with the minimal needed RSS item information.
```
val feedItems = videos.joinToString("") {
    "<item>" +
    "<title>${it.getTitle()}</title>" +
    "<link>https://lbry.tv/${it.lbryUrl}</link>" +
    "<pubDate>${it.getPublishDate()}</pubDate>" +
    "</item>"
}
```

And finally merge the `feedItems` string into the base RSS string and write it to a file.
```
val content = "<rss version=\"2.0\">" +
        "<channel>" +
        "<title>whatch.online</title>" +
        "<link>http://whatch.online/</link>" +
        "<description>Latest movies and documentaries.</description>" +
        feedItems +
        "</channel>" +
        "</rss>"
file.writeText(content)
```

## The end
That was fun. Thanks for reading.
