### Why:

A few weeks ago I started a LBRY channel called [FreeMovies](https://open.lbry.com/FreeMovies) which hosts movies that are in the public domain or open sourced. I got surprisingly good feedback and as of today 387 followers. That's freaking amazing. But the LBRY app doesn't offer a way to list all movies and/or sort them by imdb rating etc. That's how I came up with the idea to build a website to discover movies on LBRY.

### The result:
[http://whatch.online](http://whatch.online)

![screenshot](http://whatch.online/screenshots/18_05_2020.jpg "Screenshot")

### Goals:
* Keep the site static without dependencies to other services
* Good UI/UX although I'm not a designer nor a web developer
* Easy to update
* Keep everything legal (no pirated movies)

### Tools that I used: 
* [ktor](https://ktor.io/) to talk to the [LBRY REST API](https://lbry.tech/api/sdk) to fetch stream information
* [jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) to fetch movie information like genres and imdb ratings
* [sqldelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) to store the information locally in the database
* [kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html) to build the html file

### The code:
**Talk to LBRY API**:
```
val client = HttpClient(CIO)
val response = client.post<HttpResponse> {
    url("http://localhost:5279/")
    body = "{\"method\": \"stream_list\", " +
            "\"params\": {\"name\": [], " +
            "\"claim_id\": [], " +
            "\"resolve\": false, " +
            "\"page_size\": 500}}"
}

val json = Json(JsonConfiguration.Stable).parseJson(response.readText())
json.jsonObject.getObjectOrNull("result")?.getArrayOrNull("items")?.map { it.jsonObject }?.forEach {
    val channelClaimId = it.getObjectOrNull("signing_channel")?.getPrimitiveOrNull("claim_id")?.content
    if (channelClaimId != "a68e2f8fcf4a2e201bdc700fedcfcd0eb429bb7f") {
        return@forEach
    }
    addMovieToDatabase(it)
}
```

**After fetching and storing the movie information into the database the html building for the movie grid is straight forward**:
1. Give it a class for css styling
2. Add some attributes for sorting and filtering via js
3. Set the cover as css `background-image`
4. Add a redirect to LBRY via `onClick`. I know an `a` tag would be better, but I tried to keep the `DOM` as small as possible.
5. Add movie metadata like title and rating


```
movies.forEach {
    div {
        classes = setOf("movie")
        attributes["data-r"] = it.imdbRating.toString()
        attributes["data-y"] = it.publishYear
        attributes["data-g"] = it.tagsAndCategories()
        style = "background-image: url('p/${it.imdbID}.jpg');"
        onClick = "openStream('${it.lbryUrl}')"

        div {
            classes = setOf("info")
            span { text(it.getTagsAndDuration()) }
            span { text(it.getTitle()) }
            span { text(it.imdbRating / 10f) }
            if (it.hasRottenRating()) {
                span { text("${it.rottenRating}%") }
            }
            if (it.isPaid()) {
                div {
                    id = "coin_icon"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Loop through all possible genres and add them to the header. I statically defined which genres should be displayed by default and which should be hidden. The ones that are hidden will be displayed after clicking the "more" button.
```
genres.forEach {
    input {
        type = InputType.checkBox
        id = it
        onChange = "handleGenreChange(event)"
        checked = false
    }
    label {
        htmlFor = it
        if (!importantGenres.contains(it)) {
            classes = setOf("unimportant")
        }
        text(it.capitalize())
    }
}
```

### Things that didn't work:
* I tried to implement to automatically open movies in the desktop/mobile app if installed, but I only found some wacky solution on the internet which didn't work to 100%.

I hope in the future we will have more paid movies on LBRY. Please let me know in the comments if there are, I'm more than happy to add them to the site.
